# Featuring You!
This is an SAO I designed to share at Hackaday Supercon 2024.

Supercon badges are awesome! But for some reason they don't always have a spot to put your name, this is my solution. An SAO that looks like one of those big red flashing arrows - featuring you!

What is an SAO? Here's a Hackaday article about that: [https://hackaday.com/2019/03/20/introducing-the-shitty-add-on-v1-69bis-standard/](https://hackaday.com/2019/03/20/introducing-the-shitty-add-on-v1-69bis-standard/)
